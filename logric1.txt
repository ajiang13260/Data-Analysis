11 The master of my sea oh ooh
12 I was broken from a young age
13 Taking my sulking to the masses
14 Writing my poems for the few
15 That look to me took to me shook to me feeling me
16 Singing from heartache from the pain
17 Taking my message from the veins
18 Speaking my lesson from the brain
19 Seeing the beauty through the

30 Send a prayer to the ones up above
31 All the hate that you've heard has turned your spirit to a dove oh ooh
32 Your spirit up above oh ooh
33 I was choking in the crowd
34 Building my rain up in the cloud
35 Falling like ashes to the ground
36 Hoping my feelings they would drown
37 But they never did ever lived ebbing and flowing
38 Inhibited limited
